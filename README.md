## 3. Hexadecimal Numbers

### What are Hexadecimal Numbers?
Hexadecimal is a base 16 number system. Unlike the binary system, which uses two digits (0 and 1), hexadecimal uses sixteen digits: 0-9 and A-F. The letters A-F represent the values 10-15. 

### Why is Hexadecimal Used?
Hexadecimal is used in computing because it is more compact and easier to read than binary. Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to exactly four binary digits (a **nibble**). This allows large binary numbers to be expressed in a much shorter, more readable format. Hexadecimal is commonly used in programming and computer science, particularly for memory addresses, color codes in web design, and other tasks that require representing large binary values.

### Position Value
Just like binary numbers, hexadecimal numbers have place values, but instead of powers of 2 (as in binary), each position represents a power of **16**. For example:
- The rightmost digit represents **16⁰** (1),
- The next digit represents **16¹** (16),
- The next represents **16²** (256),
- The next represents **16³** (4096), and so on.

### Example: Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal

Let's convert the hexadecimal number 2F to decimal:

#### Step-by-Step Conversion:
- The hexadecimal number 2F represents:
  - The 2 is in the **16's place** (16¹),
  - The F is in the **1's place** (16⁰), and F represents 15 in decimal.

So, the hexadecimal number 2F is calculated as:

2 × 16¹ + F × 16⁰
= 2 × 16 + 15 × 1
= 32 + 15
= 47

### Practice Exercise

Now, try converting the following hexadecimal numbers to decimal:

1. A
2. 5F
3. B9
4. 7C
5. 1A3






   

#### Answers:
1. A → **10** (decimal)
2. 5F → **95** (decimal)
3. B9 → **185** (decimal)
4. 7C → **124** (decimal)
5. 1A3 → **419** (decimal)
